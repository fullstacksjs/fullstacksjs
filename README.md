## Motivation

The Internet is full of unfiltered programming content, tutorials, and forums, which provide incomplete, outdated, and sometimes incorrect information to the knowledge seekers in this field. Therefore, we decided to establish a community where experts control and review the contents and activities.This creates a community that values **in-depth** and **correct** content.

# Values

Values form our community and influence its behavior also have a direct impact on community's decision-making and contents.

* Ethics: Ethics is the most important value in the community, which has the highest priority in decisions. In the community, moral principles are never sacrificed for the sake of other activities.

* Validity: Expert approval is required for every community-produced and published content. If an error is discovered in previously published content, the community must notify the appropriate parties and update the content.
